"""Restore rendering identity for proven affine ``for`` iterators.

Layer: Rewrite/Postprocess cleanup
Responsibility: preserve the proven lvalue identity needed by angr to render
``i = i + step`` as ``i += step`` after late AST regeneration.
Consumes already-proven IR, alias, widening, typed, and structuring facts.
Do not recover new semantics, storage identity, types, call signatures, control
flow, or facts from rendered text, COD, source, or CLI/reporting evidence here.
