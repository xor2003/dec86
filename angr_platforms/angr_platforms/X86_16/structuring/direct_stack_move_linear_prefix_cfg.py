"""Project resolved CFG evidence for direct stack move linear prefixes.

Layer: Structuring.
Responsibility: expose complete normalized block membership and immediate
successors needed to prove that one instruction linearly precedes another.
This module does not inspect or mutate structured C and does not recover values,
aliases, types, or rewrite output.

Dynamic boundary: angr function graphs, blocks, and Capstone wrappers expose
version-dependent attributes. Dynamic reads are restricted to those surfaces.
Owns CFG shape, loops, switches, and structured condition lowering from proven
IR/semantic evidence. Do not perform alias-state ownership, widening,
type/materialization recovery, rewrite cleanup, postprocess, or CLI/reporting
work here.
