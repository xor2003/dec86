"""Replay binary-proven direct stack moves at structured loop tails.

Layer: Structuring.
Responsibility: restore unique CFG-proven loop-tail ownership after angr
regenerates the structured C AST and loses earlier placement mutations.
Owns CFG shape, loops, switches, and structured condition lowering from proven IR/semantic evidence.
Do not perform alias-state ownership, widening, type/materialization recovery,
rewrite cleanup, postprocess, or CLI/reporting work here.
