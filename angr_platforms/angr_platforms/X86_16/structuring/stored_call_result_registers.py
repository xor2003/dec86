"""Classify structured register carriers for stored call results.

Layer: Structuring.
Responsibility: prove that a structured assignment destination covers the
typed return register named by one callsite summary.
Owns CFG shape, loops, switches, and structured condition lowering from proven IR/semantic evidence.
Do not perform alias-state ownership, widening, type/materialization recovery, rewrite cleanup, postprocess, or CLI/reporting work here.

Physical angr register variables and the explicit runtime GP state emitted by
Types/Lowering are accepted through their authoritative typed projections.
Names, rendered C, and unowned memory variables are not evidence.
