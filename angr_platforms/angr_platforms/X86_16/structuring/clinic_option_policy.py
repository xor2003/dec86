"""Protect X86-16 CFG shape from non-control flag expressions.

Layer: Structuring.
Responsibility: configure third-party Clinic so lifter-emitted flag-value ITEs
remain data expressions and cannot be rewritten as synthetic CFG branches.
Owns CFG shape, loops, switches, and structured condition lowering from proven
IR/semantic evidence.
Do not perform alias-state ownership, widening, type/materialization recovery,
rewrite cleanup, postprocess, or CLI/reporting work here.
Owns only architecture-specific structuring options. It does not recover
conditions, alter instruction semantics, or clean rendered C.

The X86-16 lifter uses ITE expressions to select individual arithmetic flag
bits. angr's generic ``rewrite_ites_to_diamonds`` option treats every ITE as
source-level control flow. For instructions such as ``sub ax, [bp+6]`` this can
split the AIL graph at byte addresses inside the instruction, duplicate the
epilogue, and apply the arithmetic operation twice. A function with no CFG
split has proof that none of its ITEs represents machine control flow, so the
generic rewrite is disabled there. Branch-bearing or unknown CFGs retain
angr's default until ITE provenance can be selected individually.
