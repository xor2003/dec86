"""Expose exact structured condition carriers for pretest loops.

Layer: Structuring.
Responsibility: project a pretest loop's explicit header and unique leading
break guard as typed C expressions for Structuring consumers.
This module identifies only C-AST shape. It does not infer condition meaning,
invert predicates, recover values or types, or perform rewrite cleanup.
