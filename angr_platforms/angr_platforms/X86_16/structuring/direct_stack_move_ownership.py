"""Arbitrate typed control-flow ownership for direct stack moves.

Layer: Structuring.
Responsibility: expose branch ownership already proven by ConditionIR and exact
CFG targets so broader loop placement services cannot steal the same move.
Owns CFG shape, loops, switches, and structured condition lowering from proven
IR/semantic evidence.
Do not perform alias-state ownership, widening, type/materialization recovery,
rewrite cleanup, postprocess, or CLI/reporting work here.
Do not recover values, aliases, widths, types, or semantics here. Lowering owns
the assignment; this module only ranks competing structured control owners.

Conditional-arm ownership is narrower than an enclosing loop, while a loop
fully contained in the arm is narrower than that arm. A failed or overlapping
join must keep the move in place instead of silently broadening its execution.
