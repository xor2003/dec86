"""Bind regenerated structured expressions back to typed condition facts.

Layer: Structuring.
Responsibility: recover condition provenance after codegen regeneration by
requiring one unique structural AST match to an already-proven ``ConditionIR``.
Owns CFG shape, loops, switches, and structured condition lowering from proven IR/semantic evidence.
Do not perform alias-state ownership, widening, type/materialization recovery, rewrite cleanup,
postprocess, or CLI/reporting work here.

This module does not decode instructions, compare rendered text, or infer new
semantics. Ambiguous or unavailable materializations are refused.
