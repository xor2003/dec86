"""Compose structured expressions from already-proven binary IR values.

Layer: Structuring.
Responsibility: map supported typed binary operators to C AST using the
caller's operand projection. Never infer operands, widths, or storage identity.
Owns CFG shape, loops, switches, and structured condition lowering from proven IR/semantic evidence.
Do not perform alias-state ownership, widening, type/materialization recovery,
rewrite cleanup, postprocess, or CLI/reporting work here.
