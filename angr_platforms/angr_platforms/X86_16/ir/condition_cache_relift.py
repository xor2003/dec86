"""Rebuild typed condition evidence without angr block-cache side effects.

Layer: IR.
Responsibility: force the custom x86-16 lifter over exact current-function
bytes and return an isolated ``ConditionIR`` cache artifact.
Owns typed Value, Address, Condition, instruction facts, and lossless normalization.
Do not perform alias-state ownership, widening, lowering/materialization,
structuring, rewrite, postprocess, or CLI/reporting work here.

This is an IR migration boundary, not semantic recovery in Lowering.  The
custom frontend still records rich cross-block condition sources while lifting,
but angr may return a cached IRSB without rerunning those recording side
effects.  Until the complete cross-block condition source is carried directly
by ``IRFunctionArtifact``, consumers must use this exact-byte artifact instead
of treating an empty process-global cache entry as authoritative evidence.
