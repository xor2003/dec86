"""Project closed logical-memory reads into typed scalar values.

Layer: IR.
Responsibility: convert one exact byte-executed logical word-read trace into a
typed scalar storage value while preserving its segmented address identity.
Unknown, open, ambiguous, or non-stack evidence is refused without guessing.
Owns typed Value, Address, Condition, instruction facts, and lossless normalization.
Do not perform alias-state ownership, widening, lowering/materialization,
structuring, rewrite, postprocess, or CLI/reporting work here.
