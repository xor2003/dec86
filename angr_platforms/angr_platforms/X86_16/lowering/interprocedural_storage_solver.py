"""Resolve and publish SCC-aware interprocedural storage contracts.

Layer: Types/Lowering.
Responsibility: propagate concrete direct output seeds through deferred recursive
return pass-throughs, resolve complete function joins to a deterministic fixed
point, and produce one atomic publication payload. This module does not infer
signatures, mutate codegen, or synthesize missing SSA return reads.
Consumes alias, widening, and typed facts.
Do not recover semantics from COD, source, assembly, or rendered C text.
Forbidden: signature guessing or partial publication.
