"""Classify runtime-GP projections of CALL stack execution carriers.

Layer: Types/Lowering.
Responsibility: recognize only the owned 16-bit SP subview write emitted when
GP-state lowering projects a machine CALL decrement into the 32-bit ESP lane.
Consumes alias, widening, and typed facts; it does not create those facts.
Do not recover semantics from COD, source, assembly, or rendered C text.
Typed runtime-GP ownership and exact frame width are required; this module does
not discover calls or remove statements.
