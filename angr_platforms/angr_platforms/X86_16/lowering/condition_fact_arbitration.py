"""Resolve duplicate typed-condition evidence before C materialization.

Layer: Types/Lowering.
Responsibility: normalize competing ``ConditionIR`` facts at the transfer
boundary and refuse operand ambiguity before Structuring consumes the facts.
Consumes alias, widening, and typed facts.
Do not recover semantics from COD, source, assembly, or rendered C text.

This module does not decode instructions, infer branch semantics, or inspect
rendered C. It only arbitrates already-owned typed facts for the same exact CFG
branch identity. A stale self-comparison may be discarded only when one unique
non-self fact exists; multiple non-self alternatives are refused as ambiguous.
When one alternative has uniquely replaced more register/TMP carriers with
segmented or constant identities, that bound fact is stronger; equally bound
alternatives remain ambiguous.
