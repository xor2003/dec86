"""Publish direct-stack invalidation generations for covered owner scopes.

Layer: Types/Lowering.
Responsibility: expose a cheap typed generation only while every mutation that
can invalidate direct-stack replay is published by the enclosing owner.
Do not infer stability from object identity, rendered C, call order, or names.
Dynamic boundary: generation state is attached to third-party angr codegen.
