"""Represent fixed-width real-mode near pointers in typed interfaces.

Layer: Types/Lowering.
Responsibility: preserve the 16-bit ABI width of proven near pointers while
retaining angr pointer semantics and the architecture binding of their pointee.
Consumes alias, widening, and typed facts.
Do not recover semantics from COD, source, assembly, or rendered C text.

``Arch86_16`` has a 32-bit address model and a 2-byte ABI word.  Angr's generic
``SimTypePointer`` follows the address width, so it must not be used for stack
parameters proven to be 16-bit near pointers.
