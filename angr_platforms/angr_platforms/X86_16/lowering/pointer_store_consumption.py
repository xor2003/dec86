"""Prove complete consumption before removing a pointer-store carrier.

Layer: Types/Lowering.
Responsibility: separate source-preservation evidence for a proven store
projection from whole-function register-use evidence for setup deletion. This is not general
DCE: unrelated writes, opaque effects, cycles, and shared occurrences refuse.
Consumes alias, widening, and typed facts; never infers storage from names.
