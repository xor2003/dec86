"""Account for exact machine callsites represented by a structured C tree.

Layer: Types/Lowering.
Responsibility: combine exact call tags with live node-to-summary bindings into
the represented subset of an authoritative typed callsite inventory.
Consumes alias, widening, and typed facts.
Do not recover semantics from COD, source, assembly, or rendered C text.

This module neither discovers calls nor compares rendered callee names. Missing
call materialization may consume its result, while Structuring only sequences
that consumer and Rewrite or CLI may provide compatibility fallback only.
