"""Typed flag and condition semantic helpers.

Layer: Semantics.
Responsibility: owns instruction effects, flags, branch meaning, and expression interpretation.
This module exposes flag condition helpers without owning cleanup or lowering.
Do not perform alias-state ownership, widening, lowering/materialization,
structuring, rewrite, postprocess, or CLI/reporting work here.
