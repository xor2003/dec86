"""Compatibility imports for function-scoped logical-memory capture.

Layer: Semantics compatibility boundary.
Responsibility: preserve the historical evidence-cache import surface while IR
owns logical-memory capture contracts and context-local transport.
Owns instruction effects, flags, branch meaning, and expression interpretation.
Do not perform alias-state ownership, widening, lowering/materialization,
structuring, rewrite, postprocess, or CLI/reporting work here.

New capture or resolution behavior belongs in ``ir/logical_memory_capture.py``
or ``ir/logical_memory_resolution.py``. Do not add process-global caches or
semantic reconstruction here; consumers should migrate to typed IR artifacts.
