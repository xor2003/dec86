# Third-party notices and license scope

The root [LICENSE](LICENSE) applies to original Inertia Decompiler source code
and documentation unless a file or directory carries a different notice. The
same original material is also available under a separately executed commercial

The repository also contains or references material that is not relicensed by
the Inertia Decompiler copyright holder. That material remains under its own
license or copyright terms. In particular, do not assume that the root license
grants rights to:

- code retained from or derived from `angr-platforms`;
- separately installed dependencies, including angr and the other packages
  listed in `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt`;
- content under `borrow/`;
- papers and extracted research text under `decompile/`;
- third-party games, executables, object files, listings, libraries, debug
  information, and corpus inputs under `cod/`, `deep/`, `examples/`,
  `signature_catalogs/`, or elsewhere in the repository; or
- any file carrying its own copyright or license notice.

## Distribution review

Before publishing a source archive, Python package, benchmark corpus, signature
bundle, or commercial build, review the included files and distribute only
material for which the required rights and notices are available. Inclusion in
the Git repository is not by itself evidence of permission for commercial
redistribution.
